Cascade hops are a true dual-purpose hop that can be used for bittering, late aroma additions, or dry hopping in the fermenter. Used in so many craft brewed pale ales, but none more famous than Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. You can't go wrong using Cascade hops in all kinds of American style ales. Alpha Acids: 4.5\u20137.0% Total Oils per 100g dried: 0.8\u20131.5 ml Used in: American Pale Ale II (flavor/aroma, 2 oz., 5 min), Eskimo Amber (bittering, 1 oz., 60 min), Hop Blonde Ale (bittering, 1 oz., 60 min) Centennial Centennial hops are a balanced bittering and aromatic hop with a decidedly American nature and uniquely pungent flavor. An intense citrus aroma with pronounced lemon notes also gives off some floral qualities that blend well with West Coast IPAs, American Pale Ales, and other hop-forward styles. Centennial hops are sometimes referenced as a super-charged Cascade without the grapefruit flavors. Centennial hops also blend well with Chinook and Columbus hops. Alpha Acids: 9.5\u201311.5% Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.5\u20132.5 ml Chinook Chinook hops are a very distinctive dual-purpose hop used in Ales for both bittering and flavor/aroma. Chinook hops are commonly used in West Coast style IPAs. Its distinct, medium-intensity spice and pine characteristics include subtle notes of grapefruit. Some consider the bittering quality of this hop to be a bit rough because it has a lingering quality. On the other hand, some brewers can't get enough! The flavor/aroma is spicy and unique, with a huge following of loyal fans. Alpha Acids: 12.0\u201314.0% Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.5\u20132.5 ml Columbus Columbus, or CTZ (Columbus-Tomahawk-Zeus), is a high-alpha varietal with a neutral bitterness and intense aroma. A true dual-purpose hop that works very well for bittering, but shines just as easily as a late addition. CTZ hops have an earthy, spicy character that is great for bittering. But when used as an aroma addition, you'll find more floral and citrus notes come out that can be very pungent. Columbus is a perfect choice for IPAs, Pales, Imperial Ales, Hazys, Stouts, and Lagers. Alpha Acids: 14.0\u201316.0% Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.5\u20132.0 ml Used in: Columbus IPA (bittering, 1 oz., 60 minutes; flavor/aroma, 2 oz., 5 min; flavor/aroma, 2 oz., 1 min) Czech Saaz Traditional Czech Saaz (\"sahz\") hops are most commonly chosen for aromatic additions to Pilsners and Lagers, but also work well in Light Ales and Belgians. Though alpha acids are low, they are used for both bittering and an aroma of pleasant earthy, herbal, and floral notes. You can finish just about any Lager recipe with this versatile hop. Even though it has a low alpha-acid content, you will find many traditional recipes using this hop for both bittering and for flavor/aroma additions.
