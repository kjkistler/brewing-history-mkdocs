# Hops

## Cascade

Cascade hops are the classic American hop, defined by its citrus -- and often, more specifically, grapefruit -- flavor. Cascade hops are a true dual-purpose hop that can be used for bittering, late aroma additions, or dry hopping in the fermenter. Cascade hops are used in many craft-brewed pale ales, none more famous than Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. You can't go wrong using Cascade hops in all kinds of American style ales.

* Alpha Acids: 4.5–7.0%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 0.8–1.5 ml
* Used in: American Pale Ale II (flavor/aroma, 2 oz., 5 min), Eskimo Amber (bittering, 1 oz., 60 min), Hop Blonde Ale (bittering, 1 oz., 60 min)

## Centennial

Centennial hops are a balanced bittering and aromatic hop with a decidedly American nature and uniquely pungent flavor. An intense citrus aroma with pronounced lemon notes also gives off floral qualities that blend well with West Coast IPAs, American Pale Ales, and other hop-forward styles. Centennial hops are sometimes viewed as a super-charged Cascade without the grapefruit flavors. Centennial hops also blend well with Chinook and Columbus hops.

* Alpha Acids: 9.5–11.5%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.5–2.5 ml

## Chinook

Chinook hops are a distinctive dual-purpose hop used in Ales for both bittering and flavor/aroma additions. Chinook hops are commonly used in West Coast IPAs. Its distinct, medium-intensity spice and pine characteristics include subtle notes of grapefruit. Some consider the bittering contribution of this hop to be a bit rough because it has a lingering quality. On the other hand, some brewers can't get enough! The flavor and aroma are spicy and unique, with a huge following of loyal fans.

* Alpha Acids: 12.0–14.0%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.5–2.5 ml

## Columbus

Columbus, or CTZ (Columbus-Tomahawk-Zeus), is a high-alpha varietal with a neutral bitterness and intense aroma. A true dual-purpose hop that works very well for bittering, but shines just as easily as a late-boil addition. CTZ hops have an earthy, spicy character that is great for bittering. But when used as an aroma addition, you'll find more floral and citrus notes that can be quite pungent. Columbus is a perfect choice for IPAs, Pale Ales, Imperial Ales, Hazys, Stouts, and Lagers.

* Alpha Acids: 14.0–16.0%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.5–2.0 ml
* Used in: Columbus IPA (bittering, 1 oz., 60 minutes; flavor/aroma, 2 oz., 5 min; flavor/aroma, 2 oz., 1 min)

## Czech Saaz

Traditional Czech Saaz ("sahz") hops are most commonly chosen for aromatic additions to Pilsners and Lagers, but also work well in Light Ales and Belgians. Though alpha acids are low, they are used for both bittering and an aroma of pleasant earthy, herbal, and floral notes. You can finish just about any Lager recipe with this versatile hop. Even though it has low alpha-acid content, many traditional recipes use this hop for both bittering and for flavor/aroma additions.

* Alpha Acids: 2.0–5.0%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 0.4–0.7 ml
* Used in: Eskimo Amber (flavor/aroma, 1 oz., 10 min)

## Magnum

Magnum is a great bittering hop with an aroma similar to a strong Willamette. It works well with Willamette, Fuggles, and British Kent Goldings when used as an aroma hop in late-boil additions. Magnum is a useful bittering agent in nearly all beers, and due to its very smooth bitterness, you can use as much as you want.

* Alpha Acids: 10.0–14.0%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.9–3.0 ml
* Used in: American Pale Ale II (bittering, 1 oz., 60 min) 

## Northern Brewer

Northern Brewer hops are a traditional bittering hop with pine and mint characteristics. It's the only hop in Anchor Steam beer, where it's used for both bittering and flavor/aroma. Many recipes call for Northern Brewer as a bittering hop. Using 1 ounce when brewing five gallons provides a nice generic bitterness for a variety of beer styles. 

* Alpha Acids: 8.0–10.0%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.5–2.0 ml
* Used in: German Hefeweizen (bittering, 0.5 oz., 60 min)

## Simcoe

This wildly popular dual-purpose hop has become more prevalent in the modern beer scene lately, having been originally released in 2000 by Yakima Chief Ranches. Simcoe® is a favorite among craft brewers and homebrewers alike for its versatility and delicious flavors of citrus, pine, and passion fruit character. High alpha-acid content allows it to be used as the main bittering base, while its high oil content makes it an impressive aroma addition when added late in the boil, during whirlpool, or as dry hops during or after fermentation. Simcoe® has a smooth bitterness met with aromas of earth, citrus, and cannabis. Use liberally in just about any style, including Pale Ales, IPAs, Wheats, Saisons, Ambers, and especially hop-forward Hazy IPAs or Hoppy Lagers.

* Alpha Acids: 12.0–14.0%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 2.0–2.5 ml
* Used in: Hop Blonde Ale (dry hop, 1 oz., 3-5 days during maturation) 

## Warrior

Warrior® hops are a high-alpha varietal with a very smooth bittering agent. Though not typically used for their aromatic qualities, Warrior® hops can add mild notes or resin, citrus, and herbs to your IPA or Pale Ale recipe.
 
* Alpha Acids: 15–17%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.0–2.0 ml

## Willamette

Willamette is one of the most popular hops among all types of brewers for its versatility and well-rounded aroma. The moderately spicy, floral, and fruity notes compliment just about any style of beer and also blend beautifully with other hops in your recipe. An excellent choice for balanced or malt-forward beers like Pale Ale, Brown Ale, English Ales, or Porters.

* Alpha Acids: 4.0–6.0%
* Total Oils per 100g dried: 1.0–1.5 ml
